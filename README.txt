Polymorphism; Java polymorphism referee to the ability of a class to provide different implementations of a method, depending on. The type of object that is passes to the method.
While Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class, Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. And this allows us to perform a single action in many ways. For example (from java w3schools) a superclass animal has a method that is called AnimalSound(). Animal superclass could have many subclasses such as pigs, cats, dogs, pets. And from the subclasses, we c and create Pig and Dog objects and call animalSound(the method) on both of them.
 
Java inheritance--- with inheritance, it is possible to inherit attributes and method from one class to another. the inheritance can be grouped into two categories. The subclass and the superclass. The word extends is used to inherit from a class. For example a class parent could have different attributes like last name, shape of nose. These attributes could be inherited by different subclasses, children by adding the keyword extends. By doing this, the children could then in heritage their parents, last name, shape of nose etc. inheritance is useful when u want to reuse attributes and method of an existing class when u create a new class.
Overloading---> with method overloading, multiple methods can have the same name with different parameter. Instead of defining two methods that should do the same thing, it is better to overload one. The way I understand it is, is if you have a method that takes different parameters but the objects take different parameters could be more or less and you dont want to create a whole other one, it is better to overload, create another method with same name that takes those different parameter. That way java recognizes it and does not give you an error.
